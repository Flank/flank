# Non-deterministic issue when parsing JUnitReport.xml generated by Flank 20.06.2 [#872](https://github.com/Flank/flank/issues/872)



## Description

After updating from Flank 8.0.1 to 20.06.2 and switching to server-side sharding sometimes on our CI (TeamCity) we see following error when parsing `JUnitReport.xml`:
```

The issue is non-deterministic, in most cases the report gets parsed, but this never happened to us when using Flank 8. Did anyone already run into the problem? Any ideas what could be a cause? The XML files look correct for me, I compared two files from failed and successful runs, the difference is only in reported time of running tests, both files do not contain BOM marker (checked using vim).

**To Reproduce**

1. Run tests using Flank and then try to parse the report using TeamCity's report parsing feature.

**Expected behavior**

No error raised by TeamCity when parsing the `JUnitReport.xml`.

**Details (please complete the following information):**

Flank 20.06.2

##### Additional info

Asked user for providing raport which fails on TeamCity CI and he replied with failing report fail:

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?>
<testsuites>
  <testsuite name="Pixel2-27-en-portrait" tests="2" failures="0" flakes="0" errors="0" skipped="0" time="39.151" timestamp="2020-07-01T16:46:41" hostname="localhost">
    <testcase name="loginSuccessBetaEnvTest" classname="com.miquido.play360.login.LoginBetaEnvTest" time="19.133"/>
    <testcase name="testPaymentsCard" classname="com.miquido.play360.dashboard.PaymentCardBetaEnvTest" time="20.019"/>
  </testsuite>
</testsuites>

```



## Problem investigation techniques

### Validate XML

#### Description

Attached XML report was checked using some online tools to validate XML files

#### Execution

Following sites were used to validate XML (https://www.xmlvalidation.com/, https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_validator.asp, https://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html, https://codebeautify.org/xmlvalidator, https://www.liquid-technologies.com/online-xml-validator)

#### Results

All tools confirm that provided XML report is valid



### Clear XML buffer unnecessary characters

#### Description

During research about stack trace provided in the task description, user suggest on [stack overflow ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3030903/content-is-not-allowed-in-prolog-when-parsing-perfectly-valid-xml-on-gae/3030913#3030913)that some XML files could contain bad whitespace characters which are bytes order marked

#### Execution

1. Change `JUnitXML.kt` file to trim characters suggested in post

   ```kotlin
   fun JUnitTestResult?.xmlToString(): String {
       if (this == null) return ""
       val prefix = "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>"
   
       return (prefix + System.lineSeparator() + xmlPrettyWriter.writeValueAsString(this)).clearByteOrderMarkersFromBuffer()
   }
   
   // According to occasional problem with parsing byte order markers should be cleared from buffer
   // https://stackoverflow.com/a/3030913
   private fun String.clearByteOrderMarkersFromBuffer() = trim().replaceFirst("^([\\W]+)<","<")
   ```

2. Try following code when reading file and compare it without using option to clear buffer

#### Results

No characters were deleted, XML has the same length with and without suggested "fix"



### Checking hex code of provided raport

#### Description

XML report hex code was checked to make sure that no unnecessary characters are added to the file.

#### Execution

1. The report was parsed to hex representation of chars and then in revert side. Used websites (https://tomeko.net/online_tools/file_to_hex.php, https://tomeko.net/online_tools/hex_to_file.php)
2. The file was checked using [online hex viewer](https://www.onlinehexeditor.com/) 

#### Results

No unnecessary characters found on file.



### Compare reading report with using Kotlin file loading

#### Description

By using `java.nio.File("JUnitReport.xml")` methods `readLines()`/ `length()`/`readText()` checking is provided file is different than generated similar one (also with clearing byte order markers)

#### Results

No issues found in the report



### Checking git history

#### Description

Checked git history of XML reporting code.

#### Results

No breaking changes were introduced between Flank 8.0.1 and 20.06.2



### Ask user about TeamCity configuration

#### Description

User was asked about agents count and configuration 

#### Results

All agents are docker's containers so they are always the same and the problem isn't here. 

User have 2 types of tests

1. Using MockWebServer and have ~140 tests executed on multiple shards
2. Using real backend, not many tests executed on single shards - this type of tests sometime falling

When user back to old configuration, he can still reproduce problem

Between versions user changed config from:
`num-uniform-shards: 1`
to
`num-test-runs: 1`

But when user back to old configuration, he can still reproduce problem.

## Current situation

#### Issue reported to TeamCity https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-66753

TeamCity team cannot reproduce the problem, thay asked about additional logs, but User could deliver them in next week (starting 13-07-2020), until that we must wait.



#### User is testing TeamCity CI with Flank 8 to make sure that the problem is related to Flank
