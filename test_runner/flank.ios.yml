gcloud:
  # -- GcloudYml --

  ### Results Bucket
  ## The name of a Google Cloud Storage bucket where raw test results will be stored
  # results-bucket: tmp_flank

  ### Results Directory
  ## The name of a unique Google Cloud Storage object within the results bucket where raw test results will be stored
  ## (default: a timestamp with a random suffix).
  # results-dir: tmp

  ### Record Video flag
  ## Enable video recording during the test. Disabled by default. Use --record-video to enable.
  # record-video: true

  ### Timeout
  ## The max time this test execution can run before it is cancelled (default: 15m).
  ## It does not include any time necessary to prepare and clean up the target device.
  ## The maximum possible testing time is 45m on physical devices and 60m on virtual devices.
  ## The TIMEOUT units can be h, m, or s. If no unit is given, seconds are assumed.
  # timeout: 30m

  ### Asynchronous flag
  ## Invoke a test asynchronously without waiting for test results.
  # async: false

  ### Client Details
  ## A key-value map of additional details to attach to the test matrix.
  ## Arbitrary key-value pairs may be attached to a test matrix to provide additional context about the tests being run.
  ## When consuming the test results, such as in Cloud Functions or a CI system,
  ## these details can add additional context such as a link to the corresponding pull request.
  # client-details
  #   key1: value1
  #   key2: value2

  ### Network Profile
  ## The name of the network traffic profile, for example LTE, HSPA, etc,
  ## which consists of a set of parameters to emulate network conditions when running the test
  ## (default: no network shaping; see available profiles listed by the `flank test network-profiles list` command).
  ## This feature only works on physical devices.
  # network-profile: LTE

  ### Result History Name
  ## The history name for your test results (an arbitrary string label; default: the application's label from the APK manifest).
  ## All tests which use the same history name will have their results grouped together in the Firebase console in a time-ordered test history list.
  # results-history-name: android-history

  ### Number of Flaky Test Attempts
  ## The number of times a TestExecution should be re-attempted if one or more\nof its test cases fail for any reason.
  ## The maximum number of reruns allowed is 10. Default is 0, which implies no reruns.
  # num-flaky-test-attempts: 0

  ### Fail Fast
  ## If true, only a single attempt at most will be made to run each execution/shard in the matrix.
  ## Flaky test attempts are not affected. Normally, 2 or more attempts are made if a potential
  ## infrastructure issue is detected. This feature is for latency sensitive workloads. The
  ## incidence of execution failures may be significantly greater for fail-fast matrices and support
  ## is more limited because of that expectation.
  # fail-fast: false

  # -- IosGcloudYml --

  ### IOS Test Package Path
  ## The path to the test package (a zip file containing the iOS app and XCTest files).
  ## The given path may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage using a URL beginning with gs://.
  ## Note: any .xctestrun file in this zip file will be ignored if --xctestrun-file is specified.
  test: ./src/test/kotlin/ftl/fixtures/tmp/ios/EarlGreyExample/EarlGreyExample.zip

  ### IOS XCTestrun File Path
  ## The path to an .xctestrun file that will override any .xctestrun file contained in the --test package.
  ## Because the .xctestrun file contains environment variables along with test methods to run and/or ignore,
  ## this can be useful for customizing or sharding test suites. The given path should be in the local filesystem.
  ## Note: this path should usually be pointing to the xctestrun file within the derived data folder
  ## For example ./derivedDataPath/Build/Products/EarlGreyExampleSwiftTests_iphoneos13.4-arm64e.xctestrun
  xctestrun-file: ./src/test/kotlin/ftl/fixtures/tmp/ios/EarlGreyExample/EarlGreyExampleSwiftTests.xctestrun

  ### Xcode Version
  ## The version of Xcode that should be used to run an XCTest.
  ## Defaults to the latest Xcode version supported in Firebase Test Lab.
  ## This Xcode version must be supported by all iOS versions selected in the test matrix.
  # xcode-version: 10.1

  ### IOS Device Parameters
  ## A list of DIMENSION=VALUE pairs which specify a target device to test against.
  ## This flag may be repeated to specify multiple devices.
  ## The four device dimensions are: model, version, locale, and orientation.
  # device:
  #  - model: iphone8
  #   version: 12.0
  #   locale: en
  #   orientation: portrait
  # - model: iphonex
  #   version: 12.0
  #   locale: es_ES
  #   orientation: landscape

  ### Directories to Pull
  ## A list of paths that will be copied from the device's storage to the designated results bucket after the test
  ## is complete. These must be absolute paths under /private/var/mobile/Media or /Documents
  ## of the app under test. If the path is under an app's /Documents, it must be prefixed with the app's bundle id and a colon
  # directories-to-pull:
  #   - /private/var/mobile/Media

  ### Other File paths
  ## A list of device-path=file-path pairs that specify the paths of the test device and the files you want pushed to the device prior to testing.
  ## Device paths should either be under the Media shared folder (e.g. prefixed with /private/var/mobile/Media) or
  ## within the documents directory of the filesystem of an app under test (e.g. /Documents). Device paths to app
  ## filesystems should be prefixed by the bundle ID and a colon. Source file paths may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage (gs://…).
  # other-files
  #   - com.my.app:/Documents/file.txt: local/file.txt
  #   - /private/var/mobile/Media/file.jpg: gs://bucket/file.jpg

  ### Additional IPA's
  ## List of up to 100 additional IPAs to install, in addition to the one being directly tested.
  ## The path may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage using gs:// notation.
  # additional-ipas:
  #   - gs://bucket/additional.ipa
  #   - path/to/local/ipa/file.ipa

  ### Scenario Numbers
  ## A list of game-loop scenario numbers which will be run as part of the test (default: all scenarios).
  ## A maximum of 1024 scenarios may be specified in one test matrix, but the maximum number may also be limited by the overall test --timeout setting.
  # scenario-numbers:
  #   - 1
  #   - 2
  #   - 3

  ### Test type
  ## The type of iOS test to run. TYPE must be one of: xctest, game-loop. Default: xctest
  # type: xctest

  ### Application Path
  ## The path to the application archive (.ipa file) for game-loop testing.
  ## The path may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage using gs:// notation.
  ## This flag is only valid when --type=game-loop is also set
  # app:
  #  - gs://bucket/additional.ipa OR path/to/local/ipa/file.ipa

  ### Testing with Special Entitlements
  ## Enables testing special app entitlements. Re-signs an app having special entitlements with a new application-identifier.
  ## This currently supports testing Push Notifications (aps-environment) entitlement for up to one app in a project.
  ## Note: Because this changes the app's identifier, make sure none of the resources in your zip file contain direct references to the test app's bundle id.
  # test-special-entitlements: false

  # -- FlankYml --

  ### Max Test Shards
  ## test shards - the amount of groups to split the test suite into
  ## set to -1 to use one shard per test. default: 1
  # max-test-shards: 1

  ## Shard Time
  ## shard time - the amount of time tests within a shard should take
  ## when set to > 0, the shard count is dynamically set based on time up to the maximum limit defined by max-test-shards
  ## 2 minutes (120) is recommended.
  ## default: -1 (unlimited)
  # shard-time: -1

  ### Number of Test Runs
  ## test runs - the amount of times to run the tests.
  ## 1 runs the tests once. 10 runs all the tests 10x
  # num-test-runs: 1

  ### Smart Flank GCS Paths
  ## Google cloud storage path to store the JUnit XML results from the last run.
  # smart-flank-gcs-path: gs://tmp_flank/flank/test_app_ios.xml

  ### Smart Flank Disable Upload flag
  ## Disables smart flank JUnit XML uploading. Useful for preventing timing data from being updated.
  ## Default: false
  # smart-flank-disable-upload: false

  ### Use Average Test Time For New Tests flag
  ## Enable using average time from previous tests duration when using SmartShard and tests did not run before.
  ## Default: false
  # use-average-test-time-for-new-tests: true

  ### Default Test Time
  ## Set default test time used for calculating shards.
  ## Default: 120.0
  # default-test-time: 15

  ### Default Class Test Time
  ## Set default test time (in seconds) used for calculating shards of parametrized classes when previous tests results are not available.
  ## Default test time for classes should be different from the default time for test
  ## Default: 240.0
  # default-class-test-time: 30

  ### Disable Sharding flag
  ## Disables sharding. Useful for parameterized tests.
  # disable-sharding: false

  ### Test targets always Run
  ## always run - these tests are inserted at the beginning of every shard
  ## Execution order is not guaranteed by Flank. Users are responsible for configuring their own device test runner logic.
  # test-targets-always-run:
  #   - className/testName

  ### Files to Download
  ## regex is matched against bucket paths, for example: 2019-01-09_00:18:07.314000_hCMY/shard_0/EarlGreyExampleSwiftTests_iphoneos12.1-arm64e.xctestrun
  # files-to-download:
  #   - .*\.mp4$

  # -- IosFlankYml --

  ### Test Targets
  ## test targets - a list of tests to run. omit to run all tests.
  # test-targets:
  #   - className/testName

  ### Billing Project Name
  ## The billing enabled Google Cloud Platform project name to use
  # project: flank-open-source

  ### Local Result Directory Storage
  ## Local folder to store the test result. Folder is DELETED before each run to ensure only artifacts from the new run are saved.

  ## Keeps the full path of downloaded files. Required when file names are not unique.
  ## Default: false
  # keep-file-path: false

  ### Ignore Failed Tests flag
  ## Terminate with exit code 0 when there are failed tests.
  ## Useful for Fladle and other gradle plugins that don't expect the process to have a non-zero exit code.
  ## The JUnit XML is used to determine failure. (default: false)
  # ignore-failed-tests: true

  ### Output Style
  ## Output style of execution status. May be one of [verbose, multi, single, compact].
  ## For runs with only one test execution the default value is 'verbose', in other cases
  ## 'multi' is used as the default. The output style 'multi' is not displayed correctly on consoles
  ## which don't support ansi codes, to avoid corrupted output use single or verbose.
  ## The output style `compact` is used to produce less detailed output, it prints just Args, test and matrix count, weblinks, cost, and result reports.
  # output-style: single

  ### Full Junit Result flag

  ## Default: false
  # disable-usage-statistics: false

  ### Only Test Configuration
  ## Constrains a test action to only test a specified test configuration within a test plan and exclude all other test configurations.
  ## Flank can combine multiple constraint options, but -only-test-configuration has precedence over -skip-test-configuration.
  ## Each test configuration name must match the name of a configuration specified in a test plan and is case-sensitive.
  ## Default: null (run all test configurations)
  # only-test-configuration: en

  ### Skip Test Configuration
  ## Constrains a test action to skip a specified test configuration and include all other test configurations.
  ## Flank can combine multiple constraint options, but -only-test-configuration has precedence over -skip-test-configuration.
  ## Each test configuration name must match the name of a configuration specified in a test plan and is case-sensitive.
  ## Default: null (run all test configurations)
  # skip-test-configuration: en

  ### Enable output report with set type
  ## Saves output results as parsable file and optionally upload it to Gcloud. Possible values are [none, json].
  ## Default: none
  # output-report: none

  ### Disable config validation (for both, yml and command line)
  ## If true, Flank won't validate options provided by the user. In general, it's not a good idea but,
  ## there are cases when this could be useful for a user
  ## (example: project can use devices that are not commonly available, the project has higher sharding limits, etc).
  ## Default: false
  # skip-config-validation: false

  ### Path to the custom sharding JSON file
  ## Flank will apply provided sharding to the configuration.
