## Problem description

Problem found on pull request: [Flank needs to respect the timeout value as that's a cap for billing purposes. #865](https://github.com/Flank/flank/pull/865)

`deviceUsageDuration` still is null even if we testing on blaze plan with free quota spent

## Next steps

In future we should check problem status and if problem is fixed on testlab we should implement it on Flank
