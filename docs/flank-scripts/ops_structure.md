### Flank-scripts ops package structure

Flank-scripts `ops` packages mostly match `cli` structure, however, for widely used function there is a separate package
called `common`.
For better code organization `updatebinaries` has a separate package inside `dependencies`, as well as `jfrog` in
`release` package.
