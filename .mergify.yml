            Title does not follow the guidelines of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
            Please adjust title before merge and use one of following prefix:
            - `build` - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (dependencies update)
            - `ci` - Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (basically directory `.github/workflows`)
            - `docs` - Documentation only changes
            - `feat` - A new feature
            - `fix` - A bug fix
            - `chore` - Changes which does not touch the code (ex. manual update of release notes). It will not generate release notes changes
            - `refactor` - A code change that contains refactor
            - `style` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
            - `test` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests and also changes for our test app
            - `perf` - A code change that improves performance (I do not think we will use it)
