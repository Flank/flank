  ## The name of a Google Cloud Storage bucket where raw test results will be stored
  # results-bucket: tmp_flank

  ## The name of a unique Google Cloud Storage object within the results bucket where raw test results will be stored
  ## (default: a timestamp with a random suffix).
  # results-dir: tmp

  ## Enable video recording during the test. Enabled by default, use --no-record-video to disable.
  # record-video: true

  ## The max time this test execution can run before it is cancelled (default: 15m).
  ## It does not include any time necessary to prepare and clean up the target device.
  ## The maximum possible testing time is 30m on physical devices and 60m on virtual devices.
  ## The TIMEOUT units can be h, m, or s. If no unit is given, seconds are assumed.
  # timeout: 30m

  ## Invoke a test asynchronously without waiting for test results.
  # async: false

  ## The billing enabled Google Cloud Platform project name to use
  # project: delta-essence-114723

  ## The history name for your test results (an arbitrary string label; default: the application's label from the APK manifest).
  ## All tests which use the same history name will have their results grouped together in the Firebase console in a time-ordered test history list.
  # results-history-name: android-history

  ## Experimental!
  ## The number of times a TestExecution should be re-attempted if one or more\nof its test cases fail for any reason.
  ## The maximum number of reruns allowed is 10. Default is 0, which implies no reruns.
  # flaky-test-attempts: 0

  ## The path to the test package (a zip file containing the iOS app and XCTest files).
  ## The given path may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage using a URL beginning with gs://.
  ## Note: any .xctestrun file in this zip file will be ignored if --xctestrun-file is specified.
  test: ./src/test/kotlin/ftl/fixtures/tmp/EarlGreyExample.zip

  ## The path to an .xctestrun file that will override any .xctestrun file contained in the --test package.
  ## Because the .xctestrun file contains environment variables along with test methods to run and/or ignore,
  ## this can be useful for customizing or sharding test suites. The given path should be in the local filesystem.
  ## Note: this path should usually be pointing to the xctestrun file within the derived data folder
  xctestrun-file: ./src/test/kotlin/ftl/fixtures/tmp/EarlGreyExampleSwiftTests_iphoneos12.1-arm64e.xctestrun

  ## The version of Xcode that should be used to run an XCTest.
  ## Defaults to the latest Xcode version supported in Firebase Test Lab.
  ## This Xcode version must be supported by all iOS versions selected in the test matrix.
  # xcode-version: 10.1

  ## A list of DIMENSION=VALUE pairs which specify a target device to test against.
  ## This flag may be repeated to specify multiple devices.
  ## The four device dimensions are: model, version, locale, and orientation.
  # device:
  #  - model: iphone8
  #   version: 12.0
  #   locale: en
  #   orientation: portrait
  # - model: iphonex
  #   version: 12.0
  #   locale: es_ES
  #   orientation: landscape

  ## test shards - the amount of groups to split the test suite into
  ## set to -1 to use one shard per test. default: 1
  # maxTestShards: 1

  ## shard time - the amount of time tests within a shard should take
  ## when set to > 0, the shard count is dynamically set based on time up to the maxmimum limit defined by maxTestShards
  ## 2 minutes (120) is recommended.
  ## default: -1 (unlimited)
  # shardTime: -1

  ## repeat tests - the amount of times to run the tests.
  ## 1 runs the tests once. 10 runs all the tests 10x
  # repeatTests: 1

  ## Google cloud storage path to store the JUnit XML results from the last run.
  # smartFlankGcsPath: gs://tmp_flank/flank/test_app_ios.xml

  ## Disables sharding. Useful for parameterized tests.
  # disableSharding: false

  ## always run - these tests are inserted at the beginning of every shard
  ## useful if you need to grant permissions or login before other tests run
  # test-targets-always-run:
  #   - className/testName

  ## regex is matched against bucket paths, for example: 2019-01-09_00:18:07.314000_hCMY/shard_0/EarlGreyExampleSwiftTests_iphoneos12.1-arm64e.xctestrun
