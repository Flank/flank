## Setup

Please follow [getting started guide](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Getting_Started) to set up new module for a prototype.
There is also a [gradle plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/gradle-plugins) for simplifying usage of Jetbrains compose.
