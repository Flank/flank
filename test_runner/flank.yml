  ## The max time this test execution can run before it is cancelled (default: 15m).
  ## It does not include any time necessary to prepare and clean up the target device.
  ## The maximum possible testing time is 30m on physical devices and 60m on virtual devices.
  ## The TIMEOUT units can be h, m, or s. If no unit is given, seconds are assumed.
  # timeout: 30m

  ## Invoke a test asynchronously without waiting for test results.
  # async: false

  ## A key-value map of additional details to attach to the test matrix.
  ## Arbitrary key-value pairs may be attached to a test matrix to provide additional context about the tests being run.
  ## When consuming the test results, such as in Cloud Functions or a CI system,
  ## these details can add additional context such as a link to the corresponding pull request.
  # client-details
  #   key1: value1
  #   key2: value2

  ## The name of the network traffic profile, for example LTE, HSPA, etc,
  ## which consists of a set of parameters to emulate network conditions when running the test
  ## (default: no network shaping; see available profiles listed by the `flank test network-profiles list` command).
  ## This feature only works on physical devices.
  # network-profile: LTE

  ## The history name for your test results (an arbitrary string label; default: the application's label from the APK manifest).
  ## All tests which use the same history name will have their results grouped together in the Firebase console in a time-ordered test history list.
  # results-history-name: android-history

  ## Experimental!
  ## The number of times a TestExecution should be re-attempted if one or more\nof its test cases fail for any reason.

  ## Automatically log into the test device using a preconfigured Google account before beginning the test.
  ## Disabled by default. Use --auto-google-login to enable.
  # auto-google-login: true

  ## Whether each test runs in its own Instrumentation instance with the Android Test Orchestrator
  ## (default: Orchestrator is used). Disable with --no-use-orchestrator.
  ## See https://developer.android.com/training/testing/junit-runner.html#using-android-test-orchestrator
  # use-orchestrator: true

  ## A comma-separated, key=value map of environment variables and their desired values. This flag is repeatable.
  ## The environment variables are mirrored as extra options to the am instrument -e KEY1 VALUE1 … command and
  ## passed to your test runner (typically AndroidJUnitRunner)
  # environment-variables:
  #  coverage: true
  #  coverageFilePath: /sdcard/
  #  clearPackageData: true

  ## A list of paths that will be copied from the device's storage to the designated results bucket after the test
  ## is complete. These must be absolute paths under /sdcard or /data/local/tmp
  # directories-to-pull:
  #   - /sdcard/

  ## A list of device-path: file-path pairs that indicate the device paths to push files to the device before starting tests, and the paths of files to push.
  ## Device paths must be under absolute, whitelisted paths (${EXTERNAL_STORAGE}, or ${ANDROID_DATA}/local/tmp).

  ## Disabled by default. Use --performance-metrics to enable.
  # performance-metrics: true

  ## Specifies the number of shards into which you want to evenly distribute test cases.
  ## The shards are run in parallel on separate devices. For example,
  ## if your test execution contains 20 test cases and you specify four shards, each shard executes five test cases.
  ## The number of shards should be less than the total number of test cases.
  ## The number of shards specified must be >= 1 and <= 50.
  ## This option cannot be used along max-test-shards and is not compatible with smart sharding.
  ## If you want to take benefits of smart sharding use max-test-shards instead.
  ## default: null
  # num-uniform-shards: 50

  ## The fully-qualified Java class name of the instrumentation test runner
  ## (default: the last name extracted from the APK manifest).
  # test-runner-class: com.foo.TestRunner

  ## A list of one or more test target filters to apply (default: run all test targets).
  ## Each target filter must be fully qualified with the package name, class name, or test annotation desired.
  ## Supported test filters by am instrument -e … include:
  ## class, notClass, size, annotation, notAnnotation, package, notPackage, testFile, notTestFile
  ## See https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/test/runner/AndroidJUnitRunner for more information.
  # test-targets:
  #  - class com.example.app.ExampleUiTest#testPasses

  ## A map of robo_directives that you can use to customize the behavior of Robo test.
  ## The type specifies the action type of the directive, which may take on values click, text or ignore.
  ## If no type is provided, text will be used by default.
  ## Each key should be the Android resource name of a target UI element and each value should be the text input for that element.
  ## Values are only permitted for text type elements, so no value should be specified for click and ignore type elements.
  # robo-directives:
  #   "text:input_resource_name": message
  #   "click:button_resource_name": ""

  ## The path to a Robo Script JSON file.
  ## The path may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage using gs:// notation.
  ## You can guide the Robo test to perform specific actions by recording a Robo Script in Android Studio and then specifying this argument.
  ## Learn more at https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/robo-ux-test#scripting.
  # robo-script: path_to_robo_script

  ## A list of DIMENSION=VALUE pairs which specify a target device to test against.
  ## This flag may be repeated to specify multiple devices.
  ## The four device dimensions are: model, version, locale, and orientation.

  # max-test-shards: 1

  ## shard time - the amount of time tests within a shard should take
  ## when set to > 0, the shard count is dynamically set based on time up to the maximum limit defined by max-test-shards
  ## 2 minutes (120) is recommended.
  ## default: -1 (unlimited)
  # shard-time: -1

  ## test runs - the amount of times to run the tests.
  ## 1 runs the tests once. 10 runs all the tests 10x
  # num-test-runs: 1

  ## Google cloud storage path to store the JUnit XML results from the last run.
  # smart-flank-gcs-path: gs://tmp_flank/flank/test_app_android.xml

  ## Disables smart flank JUnit XML uploading. Useful for preventing timing data from being updated.
  ## Default: false
  # smart-flank-disable-upload: false

  ## Disables sharding. Useful for parameterized tests.
  # disable-sharding: false

  ## always run - these tests are inserted at the beginning of every shard
  ## useful if you need to grant permissions or login before other tests run
  # test-targets-always-run:
  #   - class com.example.app.ExampleUiTest#testPasses

  ## regex is matched against bucket paths, for example: 2019-01-09_00:13:06.106000_YCKl/shard_0/NexusLowRes-28-en-portrait/bugreport.txt
  # files-to-download:
  #   - .*\.mp4$

  ## The billing enabled Google Cloud Platform project name to use
  # project: flank-open-source

  ## Local folder to store the test result. Folder is DELETED before each run to ensure only artifacts from the new run are saved.
  # local-result-dir: flank

  ## Keeps the full path of downloaded files. Required when file names are not unique.
  ## Default: false
  # keep-file-path: false

  ## Include additional app/test apk pairs in the run. Apks are unique by just filename and not by path!
  ## If app is omitted, then the top level app is used for that pair.
  # additional-app-test-apks:
  #  - app: ../test_app/apks/app-debug.apk
  #    test: ../test_app/apks/app1-debug-androidTest.apk
  #  - test: ../test_app/apks/app2-debug-androidTest.apk

  ## The max time this test run can execute before it is cancelled (default: unlimited).
  # run-timeout: 60m

  ## Terminate with exit code 0 when there are failed tests.
  ## Useful for Fladle and other gradle plugins that don't expect the process to have a non-zero exit code.
  ## The JUnit XML is used to determine failure. (default: false)
  # ignore-failed-tests: true

  ## Flank provides two ways for parsing junit xml results.
  ## New way uses google api instead of merging xml files, but can generate slightly different output format.
  ## This flag allows fallback for legacy xml junit results parsing
  ## Currently available for android, iOS still uses only legacy way.
  # legacy-junit-result: false
