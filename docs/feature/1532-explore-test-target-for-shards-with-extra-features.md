# Auto discover rest of tests when using test-target-for-shards option

Currently, when using `test-target-for-shards` you need to specify all tests manually to split to shards. If you do not
do that then only listed tests are executed.
It will be good to provide an option to auto-discover other than specified tests to make `test-target-for-shards`
better and easier to use.

# Motivation

`test-target-for-shards` is not so easy to use, this change will improve it when using Flank and give users more
flexibility and control over creating shards.

# Goals

1. New option is available on the flank configuration level
1. User could specify which packages/class/tests run on specific shards by using a new option
1. Other tests that are not specified are then automatically added to a different set of shards/shard

# Design

- Add new option under Flank configuration, possible ideas are: `plan-sharding`, `tests-for-shards`, `smart-test-targets-for-shards`.
- New option should at least behave the same as [`test-target-for-shards`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/firebase/test/android/run#--test-targets-for-shard).
- The left over tests should then be sorted into other shards or a single shard based upon the configuration provided by the user.
- Flank should fast fail if `disable-sharding` is set to `true`  or `max-test-shards` is lower than specified test shards
  by user + 1.

# API

It is hard to plan for this change to the API because by the time this is worked upon the codebase may have changed significantly influencing the usage of this request.
This option will be applied to many places in code.
Please follow up `Design` section for the implementation plan.

# Results

A new option will be created which will split sharding based on user input or an alternative flag (described in `Alternative Considered`) which
will change behavior of `test-target-for-shards`.

# Dependencies

There are no dependencies that will have a impact on this task. It is recommended to do this after 
[Flank's refactor](https://github.com/Flank/flank/issues/1317) to make it easier.

# Testing

1. Add some tests(not all) as a value to a new option
1. Verify that they are correctly split into shards and there is one more shard with rest of tests(not specified)

# Alternatives Considered

Add a new flag to Flank configuration, which overrides `test-target-for-shards` and automatically add the rest of the tests to
separate shard/shards(if max tests shards are greater than left count).
