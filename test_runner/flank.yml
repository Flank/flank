gcloud:
  # -- GcloudYml --

  ### Result Bucket
  ## The name of a Google Cloud Storage bucket where raw test results will be stored
  # results-bucket: tmp_flank

  ### Result Directory
  ## The name of a unique Google Cloud Storage object within the results bucket where raw test results will be stored
  ## (default: a timestamp with a random suffix).
  # results-dir: tmp

  ### Record Video flag
  ## Enable video recording during the test. Disabled by default. Use --record-video to enable.
  # record-video: true

  ### Timeout
  ## The max time this test execution can run before it is cancelled (default: 15m).
  ## It does not include any time necessary to prepare and clean up the target device.
  ## The maximum possible testing time is 45m on physical devices and 60m on virtual devices.
  ## The TIMEOUT units can be h, m, or s. If no unit is given, seconds are assumed.
  # timeout: 30m

  ### Asynchronous flag
  ## Invoke a test asynchronously without waiting for test results.
  # async: false

  ### Client Details
  ## A key-value map of additional details to attach to the test matrix.
  ## Arbitrary key-value pairs may be attached to a test matrix to provide additional context about the tests being run.
  ## When consuming the test results, such as in Cloud Functions or a CI system,
  ## these details can add additional context such as a link to the corresponding pull request.
  # client-details
  #   key1: value1
  #   key2: value2

  ### Network Profile
  ## The name of the network traffic profile, for example LTE, HSPA, etc,
  ## which consists of a set of parameters to emulate network conditions when running the test
  ## (default: no network shaping; see available profiles listed by the `flank test network-profiles list` command).
  ## This feature only works on physical devices.
  # network-profile: LTE

  ### Result History Name
  ## The history name for your test results (an arbitrary string label; default: the application's label from the APK manifest).
  ## All tests which use the same history name will have their results grouped together in the Firebase console in a time-ordered test history list.
  # results-history-name: android-history

  ### Number of Flaky Test Attempts
  ## The number of times a TestExecution should be re-attempted if one or more\nof its test cases fail for any reason.
  ## The maximum number of reruns allowed is 10. Default is 0, which implies no reruns.
  # num-flaky-test-attempts: 0

  ### Fail Fast
  ## If true, only a single attempt at most will be made to run each execution/shard in the matrix.
  ## Flaky test attempts are not affected. Normally, 2 or more attempts are made if a potential
  ## infrastructure issue is detected. This feature is for latency sensitive workloads. The
  ## incidence of execution failures may be significantly greater for fail-fast matrices and support
  ## is more limited because of that expectation.
  # fail-fast: false

  ### Performance Metric flag
  ## Monitor and record performance metrics: CPU, memory, network usage, and FPS (game-loop only).
  ## Disabled by default. Use --performance-metrics to enable.
  # performance-metrics: true

  ### Number of Uniform Shards
  ## Specifies the number of shards into which you want to evenly distribute test cases.
  ## The shards are run in parallel on separate devices. For example,
  ## if your test execution contains 20 test cases and you specify four shards, each shard executes five test cases.
  ## The number of shards should be less than the total number of test cases.
  ## The number of shards specified must be >= 1 and <= 50.
  ## This option cannot be used along max-test-shards and is not compatible with smart sharding.
  ## If you want to take benefits of smart sharding use max-test-shards instead.
  ## default: null
  # num-uniform-shards: 50

  ### Robo Directives
  ## A map of robo_directives that you can use to customize the behavior of Robo test.
  ## The type specifies the action type of the directive, which may take on values click, text or ignore.
  ## If no type is provided, text will be used by default.
  ## Each key should be the Android resource name of a target UI element and each value should be the text input for that element.
  ## Values are only permitted for text type elements, so no value should be specified for click and ignore type elements.
  # robo-directives:
  #   "text:input_resource_name": message
  #   "click:button_resource_name": ""

  ### Robo Scripts
  ## The path to a Robo Script JSON file.
  ## The path may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage using gs:// notation.
  ## You can guide the Robo test to perform specific actions by recording a Robo Script in Android Studio and then specifying this argument.
  ## Learn more at https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/robo-ux-test#scripting.
  # robo-script: path_to_robo_script

  ### Android Device Parameters
  ## A list of DIMENSION=VALUE pairs which specify a target device to test against.

  ## The shards are run in parallel on separate devices. You can repeat this flag up to 50 times to specify multiple shards when one or more physical devices are selected,
  ## or up to 500 times when no physical devices are selected.
  ## Note: If you include the flags environment-variable or test-targets when running test-targets-for-shard, the flags are applied to all the shards you create.
  # test-target-for-shard:
  # - package com.package1.for.shard1
  # - package com.package1.for.shard2

  ### parameterized-tests
  ## Specifies how to handle tests which contain the parameterization annotation.
  ## 3 options are available
  ## default: treat Parameterized tests as normal and shard accordingly
  ## ignore-all: Parameterized tests are ignored and not sharded
  ## shard-into-single: Parameterized tests are collected and put into a single shard
  ## shard-into-multiple: Parameterized tests are collected and sharded into different shards based upon matching names. (Experimental)
  ## Note: If left blank default is used. Default usage may result in significant increase/difference of shard times observed
  ## Note: If shard-into-single is used, a single additional shard is created that will run the Parameterized tests separately.
  ## Note: If shard-into-multiple is used, each parameterized test will be matched by its corresponding name and sharded into a separate shard.
  ##       This may dramatically increase the amount of expected shards depending upon how many parameterized tests are discovered.
  # parameterized-tests: default

  ### Keep File Path flag
  ## Keeps the full path of downloaded files. Required when file names are not unique.
  ## Default: false
  # keep-file-path: false

  ### Additional App/Test APKS
  ## Include additional app/test apk pairs in the run. Apks are unique by just filename and not by path!

  ## The JUnit XML is used to determine failure. (default: false)
  # ignore-failed-tests: true

  ### Legacy Junit Results flag
  ## Flank provides two ways for parsing junit xml results.
  ## New way uses google api instead of merging xml files, but can generate slightly different output format.
  ## This flag allows fallback for legacy xml junit results parsing
  ## Currently available for android, iOS still uses only legacy way.
  # legacy-junit-result: false

  ### Output Style flag
  ## Output style of execution status. May be one of [verbose, multi, single, compact].
  ## For runs with only one test execution the default value is 'verbose', in other cases
  ## 'multi' is used as the default. The output style 'multi' is not displayed correctly on consoles
  ## which don't support ansi codes, to avoid corrupted output use single or verbose.
  ## The output style `compact` is used to produce less detailed output, it prints just Args, test and matrix count, weblinks, cost, and result reports.
  # output-style: single

  ### Disable usage statistics flag
  ## Disable sending usage statistics (without sensitive data) to the analytic tool.
  ## Default: false
  # disable-usage-statistics: false

  ### Enable output report with set type
  ## Saves output results as parsable file and optionally upload it to Gcloud. Possible values are [none, json].
  ## Default: none
  # output-report: none

  ### Disable config validation (for both, yml and command line)
  ## If true, Flank won't validate options provided by the user. In general, it's not a good idea but,
  ## there are cases when this could be useful for a user
  ## (example: project can use devices that are not commonly available, the project has higher sharding limits, etc).
  ## Default: false
  # skip-config-validation: false

  ### Path to the custom sharding JSON file
  ## Flank will apply provided sharding to the configuration.
