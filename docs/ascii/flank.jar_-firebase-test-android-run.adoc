== Options

*-h*, *--help*::
  Prints this help message

*--dry*::
  Dry run on mock server

*-c*, *--config*=_<configPath>_::
  YAML config file path

*--obfuscate*::
  Replacing internal test names with unique identifiers when using --dump-shards option to avoid exposing internal details

*--device*=_<String=String>_[,_<String=String>_...]::
  A list of DIMENSION=VALUE pairs which specify a target device to test against. This flag may be repeated to specify multiple devices. The four device dimensions are: model, version, locale, and orientation. If any dimensions are omitted, they will use a default value. Omitting all of the preceding dimension-related flags will run tests against a single device using defaults for all four device dimensions.

*--results-bucket*=_<resultsBucket>_::
  The name of a Google Cloud Storage bucket where raw test results will be stored (default: "test-lab-<random-UUID>"). Note that the bucket must be owned by a billing-enabled project, and that using a non-default bucket will result in billing charges for the storage used.

*--results-dir*=_<resultsDir>_::
  The name of a unique Google Cloud Storage object within the results bucket where raw test results will be stored (default: a timestamp with a random suffix). Caution: if specified, this argument must be unique for each test matrix you create, otherwise results from multiple test matrices will be overwritten or intermingled.

*--record-video*::
  Enable video recording during the test. Disabled by default.

*--no-record-video*::
  Disable video recording during the test (default behavior). Use --record-video to enable.

*--timeout*=_<timeout>_::
  The max time this test execution can run before it is cancelled (default: 15m). It does not include any time necessary to prepare and clean up the target device. The maximum possible testing time is 45m on physical devices and 60m on virtual devices. The TIMEOUT units can be h, m, or s. If no unit is given, seconds are assumed. 

*--async*::
  Invoke a test asynchronously without waiting for test results.

*--client-details*=_<String=String>_[,_<String=String>_...]::
  Comma-separated, KEY=VALUE map of additional details to attach to the test matrix.Arbitrary KEY=VALUE pairs may be attached to a test matrix to provide additional context about the tests being run.When consuming the test results, such as in Cloud Functions or a CI system,these details can add additional context such as a link to the corresponding pull request.

*--network-profile*=_<networkProfile>_::
  The name of the network traffic profile, for example --network-profile=LTE, which consists of a set of parameters to emulate network conditions when running the test (default: no network shaping; see available profiles listed by the `flank test network-profiles list` command). This feature only works on physical devices. 

*--results-history-name*=_<resultsHistoryName>_::
  The history name for your test results (an arbitrary string label; default: the application's label from the APK manifest). All tests which use the same history name will have their results grouped together in the Firebase console in a time-ordered test history list.

*--num-flaky-test-attempts*=_<flakyTestAttempts>_::
  The number of times a TestExecution should be re-attempted if one or more of its test cases fail for any reason. The maximum number of reruns allowed is 10. Default is 0, which implies no reruns.

*--directories-to-pull*=_<directoriesToPull>_[,_<directoriesToPull>_...]::
  A list of paths that will be copied from the device's storage to the designated results bucket after the test is complete. For Android devices these must be absolute paths under /sdcard or /data/local/tmp (for example, --directories-to-pull /sdcard/tempDir1,/data/local/tmp/tempDir2). Path names are restricted to the characters a-zA-Z0-9_-./+. The paths /sdcard and /data will be made available and treated as implicit path substitutions. E.g. if /sdcard on a particular device does not map to external storage, the system will replace it with the external storage path prefix for that device. For iOS devices these must be absolute paths under /private/var/mobile/Media or /Documents of the app under test. If the path is under an app's /Documents, it must be prefixed with the app's bundle id and a colon

*--other-files*=_<String=String>_[,_<String=String>_...]::
  A list of device-path=file-path pairs that indicate the device paths to push files to the device before starting tests, and the paths of files to push.

*--scenario-numbers*=_<scenarioNumbers>_[,_<scenarioNumbers>_...]::
  A list of game-loop scenario numbers which will be run as part of the test (default: all scenarios). A maximum of 1024 scenarios may be specified in one test matrix, but the maximum number may also be limited by the overall test --timeout setting.

*--fail-fast*::
  If true, only a single attempt at most will be made to run each execution/shard in the matrix. Flaky test attempts are not affected. Normally, 2 or more attempts are made if a potential infrastructure issue is detected. This feature is for latency sensitive workloads.

*--type*=_<type>_::
  The type of test to run. TYPE must be one of: instrumentation, robo, xctest, game-loop.

*--shard-time*=_<shardTime>_::
  The max amount of seconds each shard should run.

*--smart-flank-disable-upload*::
  Disables smart flank JUnit XML uploading. Useful for preventing timing data from being updated.

*--disable-sharding*::
  Disable sharding.

*--test-targets-always-run*=_<testTargetsAlwaysRun>_[,_<testTargetsAlwaysRun>_...]::
  A list of one or more test methods to be added at the top of every shard. Flank doesn't ensure execution order of added tests.

*--files-to-download*=_<filesToDownload>_[,_<filesToDownload>_...]::
  A list of paths that will be downloaded from the resulting bucket to the local results folder after the test is complete. These must be absolute paths (for example, --files-to-download /images/tempDir1,/data/local/tmp/tempDir2). Path names are restricted to the characters a-zA-Z0-9_-./+.

*--project*=_<project>_::
  The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If omitted, then the project from the service account credential is used

*--local-result-dir*=_<localResultsDir>_::
  Saves test result to this local folder. Deleted before each run.

*--run-timeout*=_<runTimeout>_::
  The max time this test run can execute before it is cancelled (default: unlimited).

*--full-junit-result*::
  Enable create additional local junit result on local storage with failure nodes on passed flaky tests.

*--ignore-failed-tests*::
  Terminate with exit code 0 when there are failed tests. Useful for Fladle and other gradle plugins that don't expect the process to have a non-zero exit code. The JUnit XML is used to determine failure. (default: false)

*--keep-file-path*::
  Keeps the full path of downloaded files. Required when file names are not unique.

*--output-style*=_<outputStyle>_::
  Output style of execution status. May be one of [verbose, multi, single]. For runs with only one test execution the default value is 'verbose', in other cases 'multi' is used as the default. The output style 'multi' is not displayed correctly on consoles which don't support ansi codes, to avoid corrupted output use `single` or `verbose`.

*--disable-results-upload*::
  Disables flank results upload on gcloud storage.

*--default-test-time*=_<defaultTestTime>_::
  Set default test time used for calculating shards.

  Google account not logged in (default behavior). Use --auto-google-login to enable

*--use-orchestrator*::
  Whether each test runs in its own Instrumentation instance with the Android Test Orchestrator (default: Orchestrator is used. To disable, use --no-use-orchestrator). Orchestrator is only compatible with AndroidJUnitRunner v1.0 or higher. See https://developer.android.com/training/testing/junit-runner.html#using-android-test-orchestrator for more information about Android Test Orchestrator.

*--no-use-orchestrator*::
  Orchestrator is not used. See --use-orchestrator.

*--environment-variables*=_<String=String>_[,_<String=String>_...]::
  A comma-separated, key=value map of environment variables and their desired values. --environment-variables=coverage=true,coverageFile=/sdcard/coverage.ec The environment variables are mirrored as extra options to the am instrument -e KEY1 VALUE1 … command and passed to your test runner (typically AndroidJUnitRunner)If you want have downloaded coverage you need also set --directories-to-pull

*--scenario-labels*=_<scenarioLabels>_[,_<scenarioLabels>_...]::
  A list of game-loop scenario labels (default: None). Each game-loop scenario may be labeled in the APK manifest file with one or more arbitrary strings, creating logical groupings (e.g. GPU_COMPATIBILITY_TESTS). If --scenario-numbers and --scenario-labels are specified together, Firebase Test Lab will first execute each scenario from --scenario-numbers. It will then expand each given scenario label into a list of scenario numbers marked with that label, and execute those scenarios.

*--obb-names*=_<obbnames>_[,_<obbnames>_...]::
  A list of OBB required filenames. OBB file name must conform to the format as specified by Android e.g. ## [main|patch].0300110.com.example.android.obb which will be installed into <shared-storage>/Android/obb/<package-name>/ on the device.

*--obb-files*=_<obbfiles>_[,_<obbfiles>_...]::
  A list of one or two Android OBB file names which will be copied to each test device before the tests will run (default: None). Each OBB file name must conform to the format as specified by Android (e.g. [main|patch].0300110.com.example.android.obb) and will be installed into <shared-storage>/Android/obb/<package-name>/ on the test device.

*--performance-metrics*::
  Monitor and record performance metrics: CPU, memory, network usage, and FPS (game-loop only). Disabled by default.

*--no-performance-metrics*::
  Disables performance metrics (default behavior). Use --performance-metrics to enable.

*--num-uniform-shards*=_<numUniformShards>_::
  Specifies the number of shards into which you want to evenly distribute test cases.The shards are run in parallel on separate devices. For example,if your test execution contains 20 test cases and you specify four shards, each shard executes five test cases.The number of shards should be less than the total number of test cases.The number of shards specified must be >= 1 and <= 50.This option cannot be used along max-test-shards and is not compatible with smart sharding.If you want to take benefits of smart sharding use max-test-shards.

*--test-runner-class*=_<testRunnerClass>_::
  The fully-qualified Java class name of the instrumentation test runner (default: the last name extracted from the APK manifest).

*--test-targets*=_<testTargets>_[,_<testTargets>_...]::
  A list of one or more test target filters to apply (default: run all test targets). Each target filter must be fully qualified with the package name, class name, or test annotation desired. Any test filter supported by am instrument -e … is supported. See https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/test/runner/AndroidJUnitRunner for more information.

*--robo-directives*=_<String=String>_[,_<String=String>_...]::
  A comma-separated (<type>:<key>=<value>) map of robo_directives that you can use to customize the behavior of Robo test.
+
The type specifies the action type of the directive, which may take on values click, text or ignore.
+
If no type is provided, text will be used by default.
+
Each key should be the Android resource name of a target UI element and each value should be the text input for that element.
+
Values are only permitted for text type elements, so no value should be specified for click and ignore type elements.

*--robo-script*=_<roboScript>_::
  The path to a Robo Script JSON file.
+
The path may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage using gs:// notation.
+
You can guide the Robo test to perform specific actions by recording a Robo Script in Android Studio and then specifying this argument.
+
Learn more at https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/robo-ux-test#scripting. 

*--test-targets-for-shard*=_<testTargetsForShard>_::
  Specifies a group of packages, classes, and/or test cases to run in each shard (a group of test cases). The shards are run in parallel on separate devices. You can repeat this flag up to 50 times to specify multiple shards when one or more physical devices are selected, or up to 500 times when no physical devices are selected.
+
Note: If you include the flags --environment-variable or --test-targets when running --test-targets-for-shard, the flags are applied to all the shards you create

*--additional-app-test-apks*=_<String=String>_[,_<String=String>_...]::
