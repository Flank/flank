## Exit Codes

| Exit code  | Description |
|  ---:      | :---  |
| 0          | All tests passed 
| 1          | A general failure occurred. Possible causes include: a filename that does not exist or an HTTP/network error. 
| 2          | Usually indicates missing or wrong usage of flags, incorrect parameters, errors in config files. 
| 10         | At least one matrix not finished (usually a FTL internal error) or unexpected error occurred. 
| 15         | Firebase Test Lab could not determine if the test matrix passed or failed, because of an unexpected error. 
| 18         | The test environment for this test execution is not supported because of incompatible test dimensions. This error might occur if the selected Android API level is not supported by the selected device type. 
| 19         | The test matrix was canceled by the user. 
| 20         | A test infrastructure error occurred. 

## CLI

Flank supports CLI flags for each YAML parameter. The CLI flags are useful to selectively override YAML file values. Pass the `--help` flag to see the full documentation. For example: `flank android run --help`

CLI flags work well with environment variables. You can override a value like this:

> flank android run --local-result-dir=$APP_NAME

### Flank configuration

app, test, and xctestrun-file support `~`, environment variables, and globs (*, **) when resolving paths

### iOS example

Run `test_runner/flank.ios.yml` with flank to verify iOS execution is working.

- `./gradlew clean test_runner:build test_runner:shadowJar`
- `java -jar ./test_runner/build/libs/flank-*.jar firebase test ios run`

```yaml
# gcloud args match the official gcloud cli
# https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/alpha/firebase/test/ios/run
gcloud:
  # -- GcloudYml --
  
  ### Results Bucket 
  ## The name of a Google Cloud Storage bucket where raw test results will be stored
  # results-bucket: tmp_flank
  
  ### Results Directory
  ## The name of a unique Google Cloud Storage object within the results bucket where raw test results will be stored
  ## (default: a timestamp with a random suffix).
  # results-dir: tmp

  ### Record Video flag
  ## Enable video recording during the test. Disabled by default. Use --record-video to enable.
  # record-video: true

  ### Timeout
  ## The max time this test execution can run before it is cancelled (default: 15m).
  ## It does not include any time necessary to prepare and clean up the target device.
  ## The maximum possible testing time is 45m on physical devices and 60m on virtual devices.
  ## The TIMEOUT units can be h, m, or s. If no unit is given, seconds are assumed.
  # timeout: 30m

  ### Asynchronous flag
  ## Invoke a test asynchronously without waiting for test results.
  # async: false

  ### Client Details
  ## A key-value map of additional details to attach to the test matrix.
  ## Arbitrary key-value pairs may be attached to a test matrix to provide additional context about the tests being run.
  ## When consuming the test results, such as in Cloud Functions or a CI system,
  ## these details can add additional context such as a link to the corresponding pull request.
  # client-details
  #   key1: value1
  #   key2: value2

  ### Network Profile
  ## The name of the network traffic profile, for example LTE, HSPA, etc,
  ## which consists of a set of parameters to emulate network conditions when running the test
  ## (default: no network shaping; see available profiles listed by the `flank test network-profiles list` command).
  ## This feature only works on physical devices.
  # network-profile: LTE

  ### Result History Name
  ## The history name for your test results (an arbitrary string label; default: the application's label from the APK manifest).
  ## All tests which use the same history name will have their results grouped together in the Firebase console in a time-ordered test history list.
  # results-history-name: android-history

  ### Number of Flaky Test Attempts
  ## The number of times a TestExecution should be re-attempted if one or more\nof its test cases fail for any reason.
  ## The maximum number of reruns allowed is 10. Default is 0, which implies no reruns.
  # num-flaky-test-attempts: 0

  ### Fail Fast
  ## If true, only a single attempt at most will be made to run each execution/shard in the matrix.
  ## Flaky test attempts are not affected. Normally, 2 or more attempts are made if a potential
  ## infrastructure issue is detected. This feature is for latency sensitive workloads. The
  ## incidence of execution failures may be significantly greater for fail-fast matrices and support
  ## is more limited because of that expectation.
  # fail-fast: false

  # -- IosGcloudYml --

  ### IOS Test Package Path
  ## The path to the test package (a zip file containing the iOS app and XCTest files).
  ## The given path may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage using a URL beginning with gs://.
  ## Note: any .xctestrun file in this zip file will be ignored if --xctestrun-file is specified.
  test: ./src/test/kotlin/ftl/fixtures/tmp/earlgrey_example.zip

  ### IOS XCTestrun File Path
  ## The path to an .xctestrun file that will override any .xctestrun file contained in the --test package.
  ## Because the .xctestrun file contains environment variables along with test methods to run and/or ignore,
  ## this can be useful for customizing or sharding test suites. The given path should be in the local filesystem.
  ## Note: this path should usually be pointing to the xctestrun file within the derived data folder
  ## For example ./derivedDataPath/Build/Products/EarlGreyExampleSwiftTests_iphoneos13.4-arm64e.xctestrun
  xctestrun-file: ./src/test/kotlin/ftl/fixtures/tmp/EarlGreyExampleSwiftTests_iphoneos13.4-arm64e.xctestrun

  ### Xcode Version
  ## The version of Xcode that should be used to run an XCTest.

  ## This Xcode version must be supported by all iOS versions selected in the test matrix.
  # xcode-version: 10.1

  ### IOS Device Parameters
  ## A list of DIMENSION=VALUE pairs which specify a target device to test against.
  ## This flag may be repeated to specify multiple devices.
  ## The four device dimensions are: model, version, locale, and orientation.
  # device:
  #  - model: iphone8
  #   version: 12.0

  ## is complete. These must be absolute paths under /private/var/mobile/Media or /Documents
  ## of the app under test. If the path is under an app's /Documents, it must be prefixed with the app's bundle id and a colon
  # directories-to-pull:
  #   - /private/var/mobile/Media

  ### Other File paths
  ## A list of device-path=file-path pairs that specify the paths of the test device and the files you want pushed to the device prior to testing.
  ## Device paths should either be under the Media shared folder (e.g. prefixed with /private/var/mobile/Media) or
  ## within the documents directory of the filesystem of an app under test (e.g. /Documents). Device paths to app
  ## filesystems should be prefixed by the bundle ID and a colon. Source file paths may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage (gs://â€¦).
  # other-files
  #   com.my.app:/Documents/file.txt: local/file.txt
  #   /private/var/mobile/Media/file.jpg: gs://bucket/file.jpg

  # scenario-numbers:
  #   - 1
  #   - 2
  #   - 3

  ### Test type
  ## The type of iOS test to run. TYPE must be one of: xctest, game-loop. Default: xctest
  # type: xctest
  
  ### Application Path
  ## The path to the application archive (.ipa file) for game-loop testing. 
  ## The path may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage using gs:// notation. 
  ## This flag is only valid when --type=game-loop is also set
  # app:
  #  - gs://bucket/additional.ipa OR path/to/local/ipa/file.ipa

  ### Testing with Special Entitlements
  ## Enables testing special app entitlements. Re-signs an app having special entitlements with a new application-identifier.
  ## This currently supports testing Push Notifications (aps-environment) entitlement for up to one app in a project.
  ## Note: Because this changes the app's identifier, make sure none of the resources in your zip file contain direct references to the test app's bundle id.
  # test-special-entitlements: false

  ## test runs - the amount of times to run the tests.
  ## 1 runs the tests once. 10 runs all the tests 10x
  # num-test-runs: 1

  ### Smart Flank GCS Path
  ## Google cloud storage path where the JUnit XML results from the last run is stored.
  ## NOTE: Empty results will not be uploaded
  # smart-flank-gcs-path: gs://tmp_flank/tmp/JUnitReport.xml

  ### Smart Flank Upload Disable flag
  ## Disables smart flank JUnit XML uploading. Useful for preventing timing data from being updated.
  ## Default: false
  # smart-flank-disable-upload: false

  ### Use Average Test Time for New Tests flag
  ## Enable using average time from previous tests duration when using SmartShard and tests did not run before.
  ## Default: false
  # use-average-test-time-for-new-tests: true

  ### Default Test Time 
  ## Set default test time used for calculating shards.
  ## Default: 120.0
  # default-test-time: 15

  ### Default Class Test Time
  ## Set default test time (in seconds) used for calculating shards of parametrized classes when previous tests results are not available.
  ## Default test time for classes should be different from the default time for test
  ## Default: 240.0
  # default-class-test-time: 30

  ### Disable Sharding flag
  ## Disables sharding. Useful for parameterized tests.
  # disable-sharding: false

  ### Test Targets Always Run
  ## always run - these tests are inserted at the beginning of every shard
  ## Execution order is not guaranteed by Flank. Users are responsible for configuring their own device test runner logic.
  # test-targets-always-run:
  #   - class com.example.app.ExampleUiTest#testPasses

  ### Files to Download
  ## regex is matched against bucket paths, for example: 2019-01-09_00:13:06.106000_YCKl/shard_0/NexusLowRes-28-en-portrait/bugreport.txt
  # files-to-download:
  #   - .*\.mp4$

  ### Billing Project Name
  ## The billing enabled Google Cloud Platform project name to use
  # project: flank-open-source

  ### Local Results Directory
  ## Local folder to store the test result. Folder is DELETED before each run to ensure only artifacts from the new run are saved.
  # local-result-dir: flank

  ### Keep File Path flag
  ## Keeps the full path of downloaded files. Required when file names are not unique.
  ## Default: false
  # keep-file-path: false

  ### Additional App/Test APKS 
  ## Include additional app/test apk pairs in the run. Apks are unique by just filename and not by path!
  ## If app is omitted, then the top level app is used for that pair.
  # additional-app-test-apks:
  #  - app: ../test_projects/android/apks/app-debug.apk
  #    test: ../test_projects/android/apks/app1-debug-androidTest.apk
  #  - test: ../test_projects/android/apks/app2-debug-androidTest.apk

  ### Run Timeout
  ## The max time this test run can execute before it is cancelled (default: unlimited).
  # run-timeout: 60m

  ### Ignore Failed Test flag
  ## Terminate with exit code 0 when there are failed tests.
  ## Useful for Fladle and other gradle plugins that don't expect the process to have a non-zero exit code.
  ## The JUnit XML is used to determine failure. (default: false)
  # ignore-failed-tests: true

  ### Legacy Junit Results flag
  ## Flank provides two ways for parsing junit xml results.
  ## New way uses google api instead of merging xml files, but can generate slightly different output format.
  ## This flag allows fallback for legacy xml junit results parsing
  ## Currently available for android, iOS still uses only legacy way.
  # legacy-junit-result: false

  ### Output Style flag
  ## Output style of execution status. May be one of [verbose, multi, single, compact].
  ## For runs with only one test execution the default value is 'verbose', in other cases
  ## 'multi' is used as the default. The output style 'multi' is not displayed correctly on consoles
  ## which don't support ansi codes, to avoid corrupted output use single or verbose.
  ## The output style `compact` is used to produce less detailed output, it prints just Args, test and matrix count, weblinks, cost, and result reports.
  # output-style: single

  ### Full Junit Result flag
  ## Enable create additional local junit result on local storage with failure nodes on passed flaky tests.
  # full-junit-result: false

  ### Disable Results Upload flag
  ## Disables flank results upload on gcloud storage.
  ## Default: false
  # disable-results-upload: false

  ### Disable usage statistics flag
  ## Disable sending usage statistics (without sensitive data) to the analytic tool.
  ## Default: false
  # disable-usage-statistics: false

  ### Enable output report with set type
  ## Saves output results as parsable file and optionally upload it to Gcloud. Possible values are [none, json].
  ## Default: none
  # output-report: none
```

## Android code coverage

<details>
<summary>Update your app's build.gradle to build with coverage and use orchestrator.
A custom gradle task is defined to generate the coverage report.</summary>

```gradle
def coverageEnabled = project.hasProperty('coverage')

android {

  defaultConfig {
    testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
    // runs pm clear after each test invocation
    testInstrumentationRunnerArguments clearPackageData: 'true'
  }

  buildTypes {
    debug {
      testCoverageEnabled true
    }
  }

        animationsDisabled = true
    }
}

  androidTestImplementation("androidx.test:runner:1.1.1")
  androidTestImplementation("androidx.test.ext:junit:1.1.0")

}

if (coverageEnabled) {
    // gradle -Pcoverage firebaseJacoco
    task firebaseJacoco(type: JacocoReport) {
        group = "Reporting"
        description = "Generate Jacoco coverage reports for Firebase test lab."

        def excludes = [
                '**/R.class',
                '**/R$*.class',
                '**/BuildConfig.*',

                'src/main/java', 'src/main/kotlin',
                'src/androidTest/java', 'src/androidTest/kotlin']))

        def ecFiles = project.fileTree(dir: '..', include: 'results/coverage_ec/**/sdcard/*.ec')
        ecFiles.forEach { println("Reading in $it") }
        getExecutionData().setFrom(ecFiles)

        reports {

```
Starting from Android Marshmallow we must grant runtime permissions to write to external storage. Following snippet in test class solves that issue.
If you want to get coverage files when using orchestrator, you must set this Rule for each test class.

```java
import androidx.test.rule.GrantPermissionRule;
import static android.Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE;
import static android.Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE;

class MyEspressoTest {

  @Rule
  GrantPermissionRule grantPermissionRule = GrantPermissionRule.grant(
          READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE);

  // other configuration and tests
}
```

Here's an example flank.yml. Note that `coverage` and `coverageFilePath` must be set when using orchestrator with coverage.
`coverageFile` is not used. Orchestrator will generate one coverage file per test. `coverageFilePath` must be a directory, not a file.

```yaml
gcloud:
  app: ./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
  test: ./app/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk
  environment-variables:
    coverage: true
    coverageFilePath: /sdcard/
    clearPackageData: true
  directories-to-pull:
    - /sdcard/
  # use a named results dir that's used by the gradle task
  results-dir: coverage_ec

flank:
  disableSharding: true
  files-to-download:
    - .*/sdcard/[^/]+\.ec$
```

- Build the app with coverage: `./gradlew -Pcoverage build`
- Run flank `flank android run`
- Generate the report `./gradlew -Pcoverage firebaseJacoco`
- Open the report in `./build/reports/jacoco/firebaseJacoco/html/index.html`
</details>

## CI integration

Download Flank from GitHub releases.

Stable. Get the latest [stable version number](https://github.com/Flank/flank/releases/latest) and replace the `XXX` with the version number.

```
wget --quiet https://github.com/Flank/flank/releases/download/vXXX/flank.jar -O ./flank.jar
java -jar ./flank.jar android run
```

Snapshot (published after every commit)

```
wget --quiet https://github.com/Flank/flank/releases/download/flank_snapshot/flank.jar -O ./flank.jar
java -jar ./flank.jar android run
```

In CI, it may be useful to generate the file via a shell script:

```
cat << 'EOF' > ./flank.yml
gcloud:
  app: ../../test_projects/android/apks/app-debug.apk
  test: ../../test_projects/android/apks/app-debug-androidTest.apk
EOF
```

### Circle CI

Circle CI has a [firebase testlab orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/freeletics/firebase-testlab) that supports Flank.

### Bitrise

Bitrise has an official [flank step](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-flank).

## Gradle Plugin

[Fladle][fladle] is a Gradle plugin for Flank that provides DSL configuration and task based execution.

[fladle]: https://github.com/runningcode/fladle

## Flank on Windows
In order to build or run Flank using Windows please follow [guide](docs/windows_wsl_guide.md) of building/running it using Windows WSL.
Native support is not currently supported.

## Authenticate with a Google account

Run `flank auth login`. Flank will save the credential to `~/.flank`. Google account authentication allows each person
to have a unique non-shared credential. A service account is still recommended for CI.

## Authenticate with a service account

Follow the [test lab docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/continuous) to create a service account.
- Save the credential to `$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json` or set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` when using a custom path.
- Set the project id in flank.yml or set the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable.
- (Since 21.01) if `projectId` is not set in a config yml file, flank uses the first available project ID among the following sources:
    1. The project ID specified in the JSON credentials file pointed by the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable [fladle](https://runningcode.github.io/fladle/configuration/#serviceaccountcredentials)
    1. The project ID specified by the GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment variable
    1. The project ID specified in the JSON credentials file `$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`

For continuous integration, base64 encode the credential as `GCLOUD_KEY`. Then write the file using a shell script. Note that gcloud CLI does not need to be installed. Flank works without any dependency on gcloud CLI.

Encode JSON locally.

```bash
base64 -i "$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json" | pbcopy
```

Then in CI decode the JSON.

```bash
GCLOUD_DIR="$HOME/.config/gcloud/"
mkdir -p "$GCLOUD_DIR"
echo "$GCLOUD_KEY" | base64 --decode > "$GCLOUD_DIR/application_default_credentials.json"
```

## Running with gcloud directly

flank.yml is compatible with the gcloud CLI.

- `gcloud firebase test android run flank.yml:gcloud`
- `gcloud alpha firebase test ios run flank.ios.yml:gcloud`

**NOTE:** You will need to [activate gcloud's service account](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/activate-service-account) for the above commands to work.

## Doctor

Use the doctor command to check for errors in the YAML.

- `flank firebase test android doctor`
- `flank firebase test ios doctor`

## Check version

Flank supports printing the current version.

```bash
$ flank -v
v3.0-SNAPSHOT
```

## Maven

You can consume Flank via maven.  
See the [maven repo](https://bintray.com/flank/maven/flank) for all supported versions.

```
repositories {
    maven(url = "https://dl.bintray.com/flank/maven")
}

dependencies {
    compile("flank:flank:master-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

or [GitHub packages](https://github.com/Flank/flank/packages/)

## Gradle Enterprise Export API

It is possible to fetch metrics from Gradle builds. For detailed info please visit [Gradle Export API](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/export-api/)
and flank's example [gradle-export-api](https://github.com/Flank/flank/tree/master/samples/gradle-export-api).

## FAQ

1) > Access Not Configured. Cloud Tool Results API has not been used in project 764086051850 before or it is disabled.

    This error means authentication hasn't been setup properly. See `Authenticate with a service account` in this readme.

2)  > How do I use Flank without typing long commands?

    Add Flank's [bash helper folder](https://github.com/Flank/flank/blob/master/test_runner/bash/) to your $PATH environment variable. This will allow you to call the shell scripts in that helper folder from anywhere.

    With the [flank](https://github.com/Flank/flank/blob/master/test_runner/bash/flank) shell script, you can use `flank` instead of `java -jar flank.jar`. Examples:

    - `flank android run`
    - `flank ios run`

    With the [update_flank.sh](https://github.com/Flank/flank/blob/master/test_runner/bash/update_flank.sh) shell script, you can rebuild `flank.jar`.

3)  > Test run failed to complete. Expected 786 tests, received 660

    Try setting `use-orchestrator: false`. Parameterized tests [are not compatible with orchestrator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48735268/unable-to-run-parameterized-tests-with-android-test-orchestrator). Flank uses [orchestrator by default on Android.](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/junit-runner)
    
4) > I have an issue when attempting to sync the Flank Gradle project
   > Task 'prepareKotlinBuildScriptModel' not found in project ':test_runner'.  
   > or similar
    
    - Make sure you do not change any module specific settings for Gradle
    - Clear IDE cache using `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart`
    - Re-import project using root `build.gradle.kts`
    - Sync project again
    
5) > Does Flank support Cucumber?
   
   Please check [document](docs/cucumber_support.md) for more info
