  ## The name of a Google Cloud Storage bucket where raw test results will be stored
  # results-bucket: tmp_flank

  ## The name of a unique Google Cloud Storage object within the results bucket where raw test results will be stored
  ## (default: a timestamp with a random suffix).
  # results-dir: tmp

  ## Enable video recording during the test. Disabled by default. Use --record-video to enable.
  # record-video: true

  ## The max time this test execution can run before it is cancelled (default: 15m).
  ## It does not include any time necessary to prepare and clean up the target device.
  ## The maximum possible testing time is 30m on physical devices and 60m on virtual devices.
  ## The TIMEOUT units can be h, m, or s. If no unit is given, seconds are assumed.
  # timeout: 30m

  ## Invoke a test asynchronously without waiting for test results.
  # async: false

  ## A key-value map of additional details to attach to the test matrix.
  ## Arbitrary key-value pairs may be attached to a test matrix to provide additional context about the tests being run.
  ## When consuming the test results, such as in Cloud Functions or a CI system,
  ## these details can add additional context such as a link to the corresponding pull request.
  # client-details
  #   key1: value1
  #   key2: value2

  ## The name of the network traffic profile, for example LTE, HSPA, etc,
  ## which consists of a set of parameters to emulate network conditions when running the test
  ## (default: no network shaping; see available profiles listed by the `flank test network-profiles list` command).
  ## This feature only works on physical devices.
  # network-profile: LTE

  ## The history name for your test results (an arbitrary string label; default: the application's label from the APK manifest).
  ## All tests which use the same history name will have their results grouped together in the Firebase console in a time-ordered test history list.
  # results-history-name: android-history

  ## Experimental!
  ## The number of times a TestExecution should be re-attempted if one or more\nof its test cases fail for any reason.
  ## The maximum number of reruns allowed is 10. Default is 0, which implies no reruns.
  # num-flaky-test-attempts: 0

  # -- IosGcloudYml --

  ## The path to the test package (a zip file containing the iOS app and XCTest files).
  ## The given path may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage using a URL beginning with gs://.
  ## Note: any .xctestrun file in this zip file will be ignored if --xctestrun-file is specified.
  test: ./src/test/kotlin/ftl/fixtures/tmp/earlgrey_example.zip

  ## The path to an .xctestrun file that will override any .xctestrun file contained in the --test package.
  ## Because the .xctestrun file contains environment variables along with test methods to run and/or ignore,
  ## this can be useful for customizing or sharding test suites. The given path should be in the local filesystem.
  ## Note: this path should usually be pointing to the xctestrun file within the derived data folder
  ## For example ./derivedDataPath/Build/Products/EarlGreyExampleSwiftTests_iphoneos13.4-arm64e.xctestrun
  xctestrun-file: ./src/test/kotlin/ftl/fixtures/tmp/EarlGreyExampleSwiftTests_iphoneos13.4-arm64e.xctestrun

  ## The version of Xcode that should be used to run an XCTest.
  ## Defaults to the latest Xcode version supported in Firebase Test Lab.
  ## This Xcode version must be supported by all iOS versions selected in the test matrix.
  # xcode-version: 10.1

  ## A list of DIMENSION=VALUE pairs which specify a target device to test against.
  ## This flag may be repeated to specify multiple devices.
  ## The four device dimensions are: model, version, locale, and orientation.
  # device:
  #  - model: iphone8
  #   version: 12.0
  #   locale: en
  #   orientation: portrait
  # - model: iphonex
  #   version: 12.0
  #   locale: es_ES
  #   orientation: landscape

  ## test shards - the amount of groups to split the test suite into
  ## set to -1 to use one shard per test. default: 1
  # max-test-shards: 1

  ## shard time - the amount of time tests within a shard should take
  ## when set to > 0, the shard count is dynamically set based on time up to the maximum limit defined by max-test-shards
  ## 2 minutes (120) is recommended.
  ## default: -1 (unlimited)
  # shard-time: -1

  ## test runs - the amount of times to run the tests.
  ## 1 runs the tests once. 10 runs all the tests 10x
  # num-test-runs: 1

  ## Google cloud storage path to store the JUnit XML results from the last run.
  # smart-flank-gcs-path: gs://tmp_flank/flank/test_app_ios.xml

  ## Disables smart flank JUnit XML uploading. Useful for preventing timing data from being updated.
  ## Default: false
  # smart-flank-disable-upload: false

  ## Disables sharding. Useful for parameterized tests.
  # disable-sharding: false

  ## always run - these tests are inserted at the beginning of every shard
  ## useful if you need to grant permissions or login before other tests run
  # test-targets-always-run:
  #   - className/testName

  ## regex is matched against bucket paths, for example: 2019-01-09_00:18:07.314000_hCMY/shard_0/EarlGreyExampleSwiftTests_iphoneos12.1-arm64e.xctestrun

  ## test targets - a list of tests to run. omit to run all tests.
  # test-targets:
  #   - className/testName

  ## The billing enabled Google Cloud Platform project name to use
  # project: flank-open-source

  ## Local folder to store the test result. Folder is DELETED before each run to ensure only artifacts from the new run are saved.
  # local-result-dir: flank

  ## The max time this test run can execute before it is cancelled (default: unlimited).
  # run-timeout: 60m

  ## Keeps the full path of downloaded files. Required when file names are not unique.
  ## Default: false
  # keep-file-path: false

  ## Output style of execution status. May be one of [verbose, multi, single].
  ## For runs with only one test execution the default value is 'verbose', in other cases
  ## 'multi' is used as the default. The output style 'multi' is not displayed correctly on consoles
  ## which don't support ansi codes, to avoid corrupted output use single or verbose.
  # output-style: single

  ## Enable create additional local junit result on local storage with failure nodes on passed flaky tests.
  # full-junit-result: false

  ## Disables flank results upload on gcloud storage.
  # disable-results-upload: false
